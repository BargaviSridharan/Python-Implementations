# Python-Implementations

PROJECT TITLE
Performing SVM and Naive Bayes Algorithm

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
User has been thinking that maybe a SVM and NaÃ¯ve Bayes model might produce better results for the dataset drugdataset.csv. In order to perform the algorithms, insights has been analyzed and concluded which is better among SVM and Naive Bayes for this dataset.

REFERENTIAL DATASET
"drugdataset.csv" has been used for the complete analysis of this project.

PRE REQUISITES - SOFTWARES 
Anaconda3 2021.05
Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

PRE REQUISITES - CODE REQUIREMENTS
Import Library packages - pandas,numpy,matplotlib
Load the dataset - drugdataset.csv

CODE DEPLOYMENT
Step1-> Create X and Y variable for prediction
Step2-> Create test and train data 
Step3-> Scale the data
Step4-> Perform SVM Algorithm
Step5-> Perform Naive Bayes
Step6-> Calculate insights of Algorithm (i.e.,precision,recall,f1score,support,accuracy,micro_avg,macro_avg)
Step7-> Build Confusion Matrix

CODE FINDINGS
Comparison between SVM and Naive Bayes scores for interpretting which is the best model for this dataset.
